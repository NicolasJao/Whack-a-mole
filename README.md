# Whack-a-mole
An Arduino-controlled whack-a-mole game with buttons and LEDs.

A simple electronic circuit along with some code to make a whack-a-mole game.

The key function here is millis() which allows the random LEDs to run while another loop runs that checks for your input. Kind of like multithreading but easier.

I made this for fun. I will attach a video later that shows it in action.
